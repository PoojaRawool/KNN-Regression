Refer the KNeighborsRegressor documentation https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.neighbors.KNeighborsRegressor.html Understand the implementation of the same.<br>
1)Load the following Fish market dataset from Kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/aungpyaeap/fish-market<br>
2) Perform EDA<br>
3) Use KNeighborsRegressorto predict weight of the fish using various attributes.<br>
Qn1: What is the value of k which gives you best results?<br>
Qn2:  How did you deal with the categorical attribute? Explain.<br>
